Enlighten Web Application Design Prompt
When designing my web application, please follow these brand guidelines carefully:
Typography System
Primary Typeface
Use Travelia as the primary typeface for all main elements
Travelia is a dynamic sans serif family with specific weights for different purposes:
Travelia Bold: For headers (200pt) and the secondary logo
Travelia Black: For business cards and placements with minimal copy
Travelia Medium: For subheaders (50pt, or 25% of header size)
Body Copy Typeface
Azeret Mono Light: Primary body copy (30pt with 42pt line spacing - 40% more than font size)
Azeret Mono Regular: For body copy categories, section titles, and more display-oriented text
Supporting Typefaces
Doto Semi-Bold: Exclusively for subject lines, footers, and page numbers (30pt)
Can also be used for design elements like quotation marks
Never use for headlines, subheaders, or body copy
BN Hightide with glyphs: For display applications and titles only
Embrace the alternate glyphs (especially for 'a' and 'n')
Use only for title pages in decks, never for formal applications
Type Hierarchy
Headers: Travelia Bold (200pt)
Sub-headers: Travelia Medium (50pt)
Body copy categories: Azeret Mono Regular (30pt)
Body copy: Azeret Mono Light (30pt)
Subject lines & page numbers: Doto Semi-Bold (30pt)
Logo Guidelines
The word "enlighten" must only be spelled using Travelia Bold
Never represent the brand in isolation using Azeret Mono, Doto, or BN Hightide
Never spell "enlighten" in a display setting with any typeface other than Travelia Bold

Color Usage
Prioritize legibility when using colors
Avoid stacking light and dark colors in ways that reduce readability
Black and white should be the only colors used for type unless an alternate color is needed for proper contrast
You may use the brand colors as backgrounds with white or black text for contrast
Brand Voice
Positioning: Data-Driven. Results-Focused. AI-Powered.
Messaging Tone: Professional, knowledgeable, innovative
Design Principles
Maintain clean, intentional lines throughout the interface
Embrace a modern, digital-first aesthetic
Create clear visual hierarchy using the type system
Ensure all text is highly legible regardless of placement
Use the pixelated elements (via Doto) sparingly to acknowledge the foundational elements of computing
