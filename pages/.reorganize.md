# Pages Reorganization Plan

## Current Status

1. Created folder structure for components:
   - `/components/analytics` - Analytics debugging components
   - `/components/device` - Device & app selection components
   - `/components/common` - Shared utility components
   - `/components/auth` - Authentication related components

2. Moved components to their appropriate directories:
   - Analytics debugger components to `/components/analytics`
   - Device selection components to `/components/device`
   - Common utility components to `/components/common`

3. Updated import paths in:
   - `pages/analytics-debugger.js`
   - `pages/dashboard.js`
   - `pages/app-crawler.js`
   - `pages/debugger.js`
   - `components/analytics/UnifiedAnalyticsDebugger.js`

4. Removed temporary file:
   - `.IOSAppSelector.js.swp`

5. Created folder structure for future pages organization:
   - `/pages/auth` - Authentication related pages
   - `/pages/dashboard` - Main dashboard pages
   - `/pages/analytics` - Analytics debugging pages
   - `/pages/device` - Device setup pages
   - `/pages/data` - Data export/tools pages
   - `/pages/common` - Shared functionality

## Next Steps for Pages Reorganization

To complete the pages reorganization:

1. Move existing pages to their appropriate directories:
   - `index.js` → `/pages/auth/index.js` (login page)
   - `dashboard.js` → `/pages/dashboard/index.js`
   - `app-selection.js` → `/pages/dashboard/app-selection.js`
   - `debugger.js` → `/pages/analytics/debugger.js`
   - `analytics-debugger.js` → `/pages/analytics/index.js`
   - `device-setup.js` → `/pages/device/device-setup.js`
   - `rtmp-setup.js` → `/pages/device/rtmp-setup.js`
   - `export.js` → `/pages/data/export.js`
   - `mitmproxy-logs.js` → `/pages/data/mitmproxy-logs.js`
   - `app-crawler.js` → `/pages/data/app-crawler.js`
   - `_app.js` → `/pages/common/_app.js`
   - `_document.js` → `/pages/common/_document.js`

2. Update import paths in all files to reflect new structure.

3. Update the navigation system to work with the new structure (especially in `_app.js`).

4. Test thoroughly to ensure no functionality is broken.

## Important Considerations

1. Next.js routing is based on the file structure, so this reorganization would change the URL paths. 
   This needs to be done carefully with proper redirects or URL handling in place.

2. The `_app.js` and `_document.js` files may need special handling as they are Next.js special files.

3. It's recommended to implement this change in phases, starting with components (which we've done) and 
   then carefully migrating pages while testing each step.

## Alternative Approach for Pages

If changing the URL structure is not desired, an alternative approach would be to:

1. Keep the current flat structure for pages
2. Add comments to group related pages 
3. Create a documentation file explaining the logical grouping of pages
4. Consider implementing proper routing within the application itself that doesn't rely on the file structure
